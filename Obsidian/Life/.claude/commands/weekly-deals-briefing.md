# Weekly Deals Briefing

Generate a deals-focused weekly summary with status updates and discussion questions for voice session.

## Usage

Invoke manually, typically end of week or Monday morning:
- `/weekly-deals-briefing`

Or schedule to run automatically.

## Steps

### 1. Gather All Active DCNs

Search for DCNs:
```
Glob: Work/0. DCN*.md
```

Read each DCN and filter to active deals:
- Phase NOT in: "Closed", "Dead"
- May include "On Hold" with flag

For each active DCN, extract:
- Deal name
- Phase
- Current Milestone
- Blockers
- Last activity date (from Activity Log)
- Key upcoming dates

### 2. Gather Investor Tracking Data

For each active DCN, check for Investor Tracking:
```
Glob: Work/01. Investor Tracking*.md
```

If tracker exists:
- Count total investors tracked
- Count by positioning stage
- Identify who moved forward this week
- Identify who stalled or passed
- Note next week actions

### 3. Scan Activity Logs

For each DCN, read Activity Log and identify entries from this week:
- Activities since last Monday (or configurable)
- Key milestones hit
- Issues encountered

### 4. Identify Concerns

Flag deals with:
- **Stale activity**: No Activity Log entry in >1 week
- **Unresolved blockers**: Blocker listed for >1 week
- **Milestone slippage**: Key Date passed without update
- **Investor momentum loss**: Key investors stalled or passed
- **Phase mismatch**: Phase suggests progress but no recent activity

### 5. Generate Deal Summaries

For each active deal, create summary:

```markdown
### [Deal Name] - [Phase]

**Status:** [Current Milestone or brief status]

**This Week:**
- [Activity 1 from Activity Log]
- [Activity 2]

**Investor Tracking:** (if exists)
- X investors active | Y in DD | Z passed
- Moved forward: [Names]
- Stalled: [Names]

**Blockers:** [If any]

**Next Week:**
- [Key actions from Investor Tracker]
- [Upcoming Key Dates]

**Concern:** [If flagged - stale, blocker, etc.]
```

### 6. Generate Discussion Questions

Based on the analysis, generate 3-5 questions for voice discussion:

**Question types:**

| Trigger | Example Question |
|---------|------------------|
| Stale deal | "[Deal] has no activity in 2 weeks - is this still active?" |
| Unresolved blocker | "[Deal] blocked on [X] for 10 days - how do we unblock?" |
| Milestone slippage | "[Deal] was targeting [date] for [milestone] - update?" |
| Investor passed | "Key investor [X] passed on [Deal] - impact on process?" |
| Phase progression | "[Deal] seems ready for next phase - agree?" |
| Resource allocation | "Three deals in active DD - team bandwidth?" |

Format as actionable questions, not observations.

### 7. Compile Briefing

Structure the full briefing:

```markdown

2. Gridworks blocked on model update - ETA from team?
3. CBE Equity has 3 NBOs in - time to shortlist?
4. KarmSolar still in Preparation - ready to launch teaser?
5. Team has 4 deals in active phase - capacity check?
