# BD Scanner Agent

Scan intelligence across RMEs, recent call notes, and previous briefings to surface connections and opportunities. Output is the Weekly BD Briefing.

## Schedule

- **Primary:** Friday 5pm (prep for Monday)
- **Optional:** Mid-week on-demand

## Trigger

```bash
claude --agent bd-scanner
```

## Purpose

Look across accumulated intelligence to find patterns and connections. This is about BD (pre-deal) - surfacing opportunities that might become deals, not tracking active transactions.

## Input Sources

| Source | What to look for |
|--------|------------------|
| RME Intelligence sections | Appetite signals, mandate changes, needs |
| Recent call notes (last 2-4 weeks) | Mentions of interests, opportunities, introductions |
| Previous BD Briefings | Ongoing opportunities to follow up on |
| Daily Intelligence (BD sections) | Flagged items not yet actioned |

## Processing Steps

### 1. Load RME Intelligence

Read all RMEs:
```
Glob: Work/00. RME*.md
```

Extract from Intelligence sections:
- What they're looking for ("seeking", "interested in", "appetite for")
- What they have ("portfolio includes", "platform in", "exposure to")
- Mandate/strategy changes
- Personnel changes
- Fund status (raising, deploying, etc.)

### 2. Load Recent Call Notes

Read call notes from last 2-4 weeks:
```
Glob: Work/Call Notes*.md (recent)
```

Extract:
- Any mentions of opportunities
- "Have you thought about..."
- "We're looking for..."
- "Do you know anyone who..."
- Introduction requests
- Market views

### 3. Load Previous BD Briefings

Read last 2-3 BD Briefings:
```
Glob: Work/Weekly Reviews/BD Briefing*.md (recent)
```

Check:
- Opportunities flagged previously - still open?
- Connections suggested - were they made?
- Action items - completed?

### 4. Find Connections

Cross-reference intelligence:

**Investor A needs X + Investor B has X:**
- A "looking for platform in South Africa"
- B "has South Africa solar portfolio, considering options"
- → Potential introduction or deal origination

**Investor A + Investor B both interested in same thing:**
- A "interested in battery storage"
- B "expanding into battery storage"
- → Co-investment opportunity? Market signal?

**Client mentioned need + Investor has appetite:**
- Client mentioned "need growth capital"
- Investor has "dry powder to deploy in sector"
- → Potential mandate

### 5. Identify Stale Relationships

Flag RMEs where:
- Last interaction > 4 weeks
- Previously warm relationship
- High-value counterparty (SWF, major DFI, etc.)

### 6. Note Market Themes

Aggregate across sources:
- What topics keep coming up?
- What geographies are hot/cold?
- What concerns are widespread?

### 7. Generate Weekly BD Briefing

Output is the Weekly BD Briefing:

```markdown
# Weekly BD Briefing
**Week of:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Generated:** [Timestamp]

## Connections to Explore

### 1. CIP ↔ [Opportunity]
**Signal:** CIP mentioned SA platform interest (Call 2026-02-03)
**Action:** Discuss with [colleague] about relevant opportunities
**RME:** [[00. RME CIP]]

### 2. ADIA + Actis (co-investment)
**Signal:** ADIA seeking co-investor; Actis has deployable capital
**Action:** Consider introduction
**RMEs:** [[00. RME ADIA]], [[00. RME Actis]]

## Follow-ups from Last Week

| Item | Status | Next Step |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Meridiam Fund IV meeting | Not done | Reschedule |
| CIP SA discussion | Done | See connection above |

## Stale Relationships

| RME | Last Contact | Suggested Angle |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| [[00. RME Actis]] | 6 weeks | New deal in their space |
| [[00. RME CDC]] | 5 weeks | Fund deployment check-in |

## Market Themes

- Battery storage: mentioned by 3 investors this month
- South Africa: renewed interest
- Nigeria: FX caution from multiple parties

## Questions for Discussion

1. CIP mentioned SA platform interest - worth a call with [colleague]?
2. Should we introduce ADIA to Actis for co-investment?
3. Actis gone cold - worth a reactivation call?
4. Battery storage coming up repeatedly - do we have a view?

## Output

## Skills Relationship

- BD Scanner IS the engine for `weekly-bd-briefing`
- They can be treated as the same thing
- Output feeds into `voice-session-prep` and `daily-intelligence`

## Future Enhancements (365 Integration)

When MSFT Graph available:
- Scan emails for intelligence signals
- Track email frequency per relationship for staleness
- Identify contacts we've emailed but no RME exists
